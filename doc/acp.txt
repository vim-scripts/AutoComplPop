==============================================================================
INTRODUCTION                                                *acp-introduction*

With this plugin, your vim comes to automatically opens popup menu for
completions when you enter characters or move the cursor in Insert mode. It
won't prevent you continuing entering characters.


==============================================================================
INSTALLATION                                                *acp-installation*

Put all files into your runtime directory. If you have the zip file, extract
it to your runtime directory.

You should place the files as follows:
>
        <your runtime directory>/plugin/acp.vim
        <your runtime directory>/doc/acp.txt
        ...
<
If you disgust to jumble up this plugin and other plugins in your runtime
directory, put the files into new directory and just add the directory path to
'runtimepath'. It's easy to uninstall the plugin.

And then update your help tags files to enable fuzzyfinder help. See
|add-local-help| for details.


==============================================================================
USAGE                                                              *acp-usage*

If this plugin has been installed, auto-popup is enabled at startup by
default.

Which completion method is used depends on the text before the cursor. The
default behavior is as follows:

        kind      filetype    text before a cursor ~
        Keyword   *           two keyword characters
        Filename  *           a filename character + a path separator 
                              + 0 or more filename character
        Omni      ruby        ".", "::" or non-word character + ":"
                              (|+ruby| required.)
        Omni      python      "." (|+python| required.)
        Omni      xml         "<", "</" or ("<" + non-">" characters + " ")
        Omni      html/xhtml  "<", "</" or ("<" + non-">" characters + " ")
        Omni      css         (":", ";", "{", "^", "@", or "!")
                              + 0 or 1 space

This behavior is customizable.

:AcpLock
        suspends auto-popup temporarily.

        For the purpose of avoiding interruption to another script, it is
        recommended to insert this command and |:AcpUnlock| than |:AcpDisable|
        and |:AcpEnable| .

                                                                  *:AcpUnlock*

        This option is for advanced users. This setting overrides other
        behavior options. This is a |Dictionary|. Each key corresponds to a
        filetype. '*' is default. Each value is a list. These are attempted in
        sequence until completion item is found. Each element is a
        |Dictionary| which has following items:

        "command":
          Command to be fed to open popup menu for completions.

        "completefunc":
          'completefunc' will be set to this user-provided function during the
          completion. Only makes sense when "command" is "<C-x><C-u>".

        "pattern", "exclude":
          If a text before a cursor matches "pattern" and not "exclude", popup
          menu is opened.

        "repeat":
          If non-zero, the last completion is automatically repeated.

CHANGELOG                                                      *acp-changelog*

2.9
  - Changed default behavior to support XML omni completion.
  - Changed default value of g:acp_behaviorKeywordCommand option.
    The option with "\<C-p>" cause a problem which inserts a match without
    <CR> when 'dictionary' has been set and keyword completion is done.
  - Changed to show error message when incompatible with a installed vim.

2.8.1
  - Fixed a bug which inserted a selected match to the next line when
    auto-wrapping (enabled with 'formatoptions') was performed.

2.8
  - Added g:acp_behaviorUserDefinedFunction option and
    g:acp_behaviorUserDefinedPattern option for users who want to make custom
    completion auto-popup.
  - Fixed a bug that setting 'spell' on a new buffer made typing go crazy.

2.7
  - Changed naming conventions for filenames, functions, commands, and options 
    and thus renamed them.
  - Added g:acp_behaviorKeywordCommand option. If you prefer the previous
    behavior for keyword completion, set this option "\<C-n>".
  - Changed default value of g:acp_ignorecaseOption option.

  The following were done by Ingo Karkat:

  - ENH: Added support for setting a user-provided 'completefunc' during the
    completion, configurable via g:acp_behavior. 
  - BUG: When the configured completion is <C-p> or <C-x><C-p>, the command to
    restore the original text (in on_popup_post()) must be reverted, too. 
  - BUG: When using a custom completion function (<C-x><C-u>) that also uses
    an s:...() function name, the s:GetSidPrefix() function dynamically
    determines the wrong SID. Now calling s:DetermineSidPrefix() once during
    sourcing and caching the value in s:SID. 
  - BUG: Should not use custom defined <C-X><C-...> completion mappings. Now
    consistently using unmapped completion commands everywhere. (Beforehand,
    s:PopupFeeder.feed() used mappings via feedkeys(..., 'm'), but
    s:PopupFeeder.on_popup_post() did not due to its invocation via
    :map-expr.) 

2.6:
  - Improved the behavior of omni completion for HTML/XHTML.

2.5:
  - Added some options to customize behavior easily:
      g:AutoComplPop_BehaviorKeywordLength
      g:AutoComplPop_BehaviorFileLength
      g:AutoComplPop_BehaviorRubyOmniMethodLength
      g:AutoComplPop_BehaviorRubyOmniSymbolLength
      g:AutoComplPop_BehaviorPythonOmniLength
      g:AutoComplPop_BehaviorHtmlOmniLength
      g:AutoComplPop_BehaviorCssOmniPropertyLength
      g:AutoComplPop_BehaviorCssOmniValueLength

2.4:
  - Added g:AutoComplPop_MappingDriven option.

2.3.1:
  - Changed to set 'lazyredraw' while a popup menu is visible to avoid
    flickering.
  - Changed a behavior for CSS.
  - Added support for GetLatestVimScripts.

2.3:
  - Added a behavior for Python to support omni completion.
  - Added a behavior for CSS to support omni completion.

2.2:
  - Changed not to work when 'paste' option is set.
  - Fixed AutoComplPopEnable command and AutoComplPopDisable command to
    map/unmap "i" and "R".

2.1:
  - Fixed the problem caused by "." command in Normal mode.
  - Changed to map "i" and "R" to feed completion command after starting
    Insert mode.
  - Avoided the problem caused by Windows IME.

2.0:
  - Changed to use CursorMovedI event to feed a completion command instead of
    key mapping. Now the auto-popup is triggered by moving the cursor.
  - Changed to feed completion command after starting Insert mode.
  - Removed g:AutoComplPop_MapList option.

1.7:
  - Added behaviors for HTML/XHTML. Now supports the omni completion for
    HTML/XHTML.
  - Changed not to show expressions for CTRL-R =.
  - Changed not to set 'nolazyredraw' while a popup menu is visible.

1.6.1:
  - Changed not to trigger the filename completion by a text which has
    multi-byte characters.

1.6:
  - Redesigned g:AutoComplPop_Behavior option.
  - Changed default value of g:AutoComplPop_CompleteOption option.
  - Changed default value of g:AutoComplPop_MapList option.

    new option to g:AutoComplPop_Behavior.

1.4:
  - Fixed the bug that the auto-popup was not suspended in fuzzyfinder.
  - Fixed the bug that an error has occurred with Ruby-omni-completion unless
    Ruby interface.

1.3:
  - Supported Ruby-omni-completion by default.
  - Supported filename completion by default.
  - Added g:AutoComplPop_Behavior option.
  - Added g:AutoComplPop_CompleteoptPreview option.
  - Removed g:AutoComplPop_MinLength option.

1.2:
  - Fixed bugs related to 'completeopt'.

1.1:

  - Added g:AutoComplPop_NotEnableAtStartup option.
  - Removed g:AutoComplPop_LoadAndEnable option.
1.0:

  - AutoComplPopLock command and AutoComplPopUnlock command are added to
    suspend and resume.
  - 'completeopt' and 'complete' options are changed temporarily while
    completing by this script.

0.4:

    the first match with CTRL-Y.

0.3:
  - Fixed the problem that the original text is not restored if 'longest' is
    not set in 'completeopt'. Now the plugin works whether or not 'longest' is
    set in 'completeopt', and also 'menuone'.

  - When completion matches are not found, insert CTRL-E to stop completion.
  - Clear the echo area.
  - Fixed the problem in case of dividing words by symbols, popup menu is
    not opened.

0.1:
  - First release.
